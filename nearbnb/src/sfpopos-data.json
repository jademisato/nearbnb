    "desc": "Located in the shadow of the Transamerica Pyramid, Redwood Park is one of the Financial District's greenest and most serene spots. Here, towering redwoods surround a half acre of statues and a large central water feature. Plus, the park is often empty, which means there's almost always a bench available for the hogging. Potential visitors take note: The park is closed every evening",
